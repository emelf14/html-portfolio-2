<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, This is Emel. A relentless guy who always want to make his life better.</p>

<p>I started my school life at Narayan Preparatory School, a renowned school in Narayangonj city. 
  After that, I finished my higher secondary certificate from another school. Then I moved to BAF Shaheens College for my higher secondary certificate.
  After completing my HSC degree, I got admitted to North South University, one of the most renowned business universities in Bangladesh.
  I then went to the United States of America to pursue my master's degree in marketing and international business.

<p>In my head, I always wanted to be a more accomplished person, where I could use my brain to be rewarded.
  From my childhood, I always wanted to be a computer guy, but my family never supported me in that field. 
  However, due to my family's background in business, I had no other choice but to pursue a business career. 
  After spending around 10 years in that business, I realized that I had some extra time to improve myself. 
  That's when I decided to take the opportunity and enroll in a course on Udemy called the Complete 2023 Well-developed Bootcamp, where I can learn a lot about web development.
  My future goal is to become tech-savvy, as I believe that's the language of the future. Having proficiency in web development languages will make me feel more confident and smarter than others.
  So, here I am, hoping to see you soon.</p>
